This is My First Rest API project 

You have to runservers one using python manage.py runserver which create a restful api

and another thing you have to do is navigate to ur frontend file and run live server

for this in django you should include cors headers and also in CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS you should include local host so as to accept it.
